Estimate the euclidean overlap passed by a ray within a rectangular volume
cell (voxel).


|img_ray_and_voxel|


For a given, rectangular space partitioning in 3D, and a given ray the
overlap of all voxels with the ray is estimated.
The figure shows a ray and its overlap with voxels.
A brown overlap with voxel ``3``, a red overlap with voxel ``0``, a purple
overlap with voxel ``4``, and a green overlap with voxel ``5``. The ray is
defined by its support and direction vectors. The space-partitioning is
defined by its bin-edges.

Install

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ray_voxel_overlap


*********
Interface
*********
There is one core function:


.. code-block:: python

    import ray_voxel_overlap
    ray_voxel_overlap.estimate_overlap_of_ray_with_voxels?
    """
    Returns the voxel indices and overlap distances for one single ray
    (defined by support and direction) with voxels defined by the bin_edges
    in x,y and z.

    support         3D support vector of ray.

    direction       3D direction vector of ray.

    x_bin_edges     voxel bin edge positions in x.

    y_bin_edges     voxel bin edge positions in y.

    z_bin_edges     voxel bin edge positions in z.
    """

There are two more functions:

- 2nd ``ray_voxel_overlap.estimate_system_matrix()``

Create a system-matrix using scipy.sparse matrix which can be used for
iterative tomographic reconstructions.

- 3rd ``ray_voxel_overlap.estimate_overlap_of_ray_bundle_with_voxels()``

Average the overlap of multiple rays representing a single read-out-channel.
This is useful when a single ray is not representative enough for the
geometry sensed by a read-out-channel in your tomographic setup, e.g. when
there is a narrow depth-of-field.

        np.ones(N_RAYS)
    ]).T

    norm_directions = np.linalg.norm(directions, axis=1)
    directions[:, 0] /= norm_directions
    directions[:, 1] /= norm_directions
    directions[:, 2] /= norm_directions

    N_X_BINS = 8
    N_Y_BINS = 13
    N_Z_BINS = 7
    system_matrix = rvo.estimate_system_matrix(
        supports=supports,
        directions=directions,
        x_bin_edges=np.linspace(-100., 100., N_X_BINS+1),
        y_bin_edges=np.linspace(-100., 100., N_Y_BINS+1),
        z_bin_edges=np.linspace(0., 200., N_Z_BINS+1),
    )


How it is done
==============
To be fast, the production-code is written in ``C`` and wrapped in ``cython``.
But for development, there is a ``python`` implementation.
